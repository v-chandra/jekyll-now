Dr. Vikas Chandra works as a Senior Principal Engineer in the core ML technology team at Arm. He leads a team
of researchers exploring efficient machine learning and deep learning solutions for computer vision and 
speech, targeted for always-on IoT edge devices. A significant proportion of ML computation is currently 
centralized but the future is going to be dominated by ML at the edge. This will have wide ranging 
implications in areas such as self driving cars, wearables, healthcare and so on. To enable this vision, 
Dr. Chandra is working on a variety of topics ranging from optimized ML kernels to energy efficient accelerators 
to system aware optimized neural network architecture. 

Dr. Chandra has authored 60+ research publications and is an inventor on 30+ US and international patents.
