I lead the on-device AI research team in the AR/VR group at Facebook, focusing on vision and speech/NLU 
applications. My research interests include all aspects of HW/SW co-design for efficient on-device AI.

I received a PhD in Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2004. I have held the 
positions of Visiting Scholar (2011 – 2014) and Visiting Faculty (2016 – 2017) at Stanford University. 
I have authored 70+ research publications and am an inventor on 40+ US and international patents. I 
received the ACM-SIGDA Technical Leadership Award in 2009 and was invited to the 2017 National Academy of 
Engineering’s Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. I am a senior member of IEEE.
