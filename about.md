Working in a senior leadership role in the core ML technology team building efficient machine learning and deep learning solutions for computer vision and speech, targeted for always-on IoT edge devices. A significant proportion of ML computation is currently centralized but the future is going to be dominated by ML at the edge. This will have wide ranging implications in areas such as self driving cars, wearables, healthcare and so on. To enable this vision, I am working on a variety of topics ranging from optimized ML kernels to energy efficient accelerators to system aware optimized neural network architecture. 

Author of 60+ research publications and inventor on 30+ US and international patents. I also serve on the internal patent review committee at Arm.
