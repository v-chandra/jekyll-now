Vikas Chandra is a Senior Principal Engineer in the core ML technology team at Arm. He leads a team
of researchers exploring efficient machine learning and deep learning solutions for computer vision and 
speech, targeted for always-on IoT edge devices. A significant proportion of ML computation is currently 
centralized but the future is going to be dominated by ML at the edge. This will have wide ranging 
implications in areas such as self driving cars, wearables, healthcare and so on. To enable this vision, 
he is working on a variety of topics ranging from system aware optimized neural network architecture to 
optimized neural network kernels to energy efficient accelerators. 

Vikas received his Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie 
Mellon University (CMU). He held the positions of Visiting Scholar (2011 â€“ 2014) and Visiting 
Faculty (2016 - 2017) in the EE department at Stanford University.  He has authored 60+ research 
publications and is an inventor on 30+ US and international patents. Vikas received the 
ACM-SIGDA Technical Leadership Award in 2009 and was Invited to the 2017 Frontiers of 
Engineering Symposium organized by the National Academy of Engineering. He is a senior member
of IEEE.
